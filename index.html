      <p>Dear Brothers and Sisters that are true (of the the Way of One).</p>

<p>God is here and with us all always surely.</p>

<p>If not, we're fear itself.</p>

<p>And I'm glad that this should be so.</p>

<p>If we are not with God - we are against.</p>

<p>And so I build a church that Christ Started many years ago, and continue it on as a "Tenderer to his Sheep", and I will, "Feed them as so".</p>

<p>The church as a century, from times beginning has changed many times, and now end times has come for many forms of things so it seems, church has scattered in many directions.</p>

<p>Too many divisions or 'types' (prefferal of speech, division never works so it was said in right contextual understandance or 'understanding').</p>

<p><strong>What does this mean?</strong></p>

<p>This is what I want, for God, for myself, but for Christ first before me, then me and the others also who are left here on a God stricken earth; barren of many good things as we continue to populate, I see the constance of a problem.</p>

<p>The young that come, are mainly from 'bad' offspring, what I mean, those cut off from the 'root' / aka. Jesus, or the 'Tree of David'.</p>

<p>All this means to me, is that God has cut them off, and they wonder; not in reality, but in their minds, they are born, and their offspring come in wondering, and of course wondering brings senseless sensual pleasure, and not pleasure of God's perceptual perception (for how could we have God's true vine unless we were God himself?).</p>

<p>What I mean by this is that we have too many off influences of others promoting sex and language that is often bad natured I think, I'm thus stricking a chord up with God and asking for a church to be built on God's promise to Jesus that his Church would reign, and I believe, without going through any special circumstances apart from my own witnessing with God and my life over time, that I am blessed to begin to continue the church as close as to how Jesus really wanted it.</p>

<p>That's no eating but eating right blessings.</p>

<p>When you come you will understand.</p>

<p>There will be inner and outer teachings, many will not come, as the outsiders feel cut off or neglected, this is to hope that they become pure in themselves before coming to the insides of Christ.</p>

<p>Christ is body, any one apart of God in Christ becomes brother, sister is same word, sex does not matter, but we will call sisters sisters, and brothers brothers for sake of it.</p>

<p>In this church, there is no microphone, no instruments, no music, no stupid practical timetable.</p>

<p>No sermons, but spontaneous sermons.</p>

<p>At the front of enclosed shelter building for the church, it will be like the inner of the temples in which Jesus sat and taught on the steps. Since I will be feeding the sheep, I will often sit also and teach on the steps, not more than what God gives me, but what Christ taught me, and what the Holy Spirit reveals I may be cautious to reveal as some practice and teachings are hard for me but much worthwhile.</p>

<p>As James says, as we preach, we become harder on ourselves, taking more persecutions as the others remind us for what we stand for, or what came from us that others use to robe us with again, that we find hard sometimes, as they are very hard things.</p>

<p>Saturdays and Sundays will be like Temples.</p>

<p>This temple will be open 24/7 like the Temples back in the day.</p>

<p>If not, they will be closed at night, but the reason for being open 24/7, is I don't see why in today's culture they cannot be used for people who can't sleep and need to attend a temple to sing, to find God, to find shelter, to sleep, etc.</p>

<p>For those wanting to know more, here is the idea:</p>

<p>Saturday is the Rest Day.</p>

<p>Sunday can be too for you, but this will count as extra holiness, or perhaps the day of praise.</p>

<p>Regardless, I encourage Saturday's not to be a normal church day like most churches are on Sunday.</p>

<p>Saturday's I encourage people to stay home, or at a residence (many do not have homes, which are great, it is just like Jesus back in the day, "foxes have holes, and lions have dens, yet the son of man does not even have a place to rest his head [for the night]". Meaning to me, "I am a wonderer of God, and I have no rest, by the time I do, how am I with God? And look - no one offers me comfort, and the comfort I find in a house, a home, is somewhat false, better I walk for God, for I know [inside], that deep down [inside], my mission will be short".</p>

<p>So how powerful are those who are in poverty without a home, such strengths in their mindset, I would not say so unless I had not become perceived to be homeless as times, and actually have walked as thus also. So I do share in my brothers love for the wilderness of God, and love to find what is rest, and "solitude".</p>

<p>Now I am not like this, now, I am wanting to denounce my family, my friends, my associates, and return to God in the best way possible, because I am built on the foundation, many thoughts in my mind have been asking what is happening to God's house, what is happening to Jesus' real home or place of worship setup for God and the Christ brothers [and sisters]?.</p>

<p>I conclude, I am willing, to follow this funny thought and vision which seems so solid this morning in my awakening and calling for God that I must set this church up:</p>

<p>Acquiring funds, money [accepted into the treasurer, not handled by me, but by another, initially I am handling this, it is easy not to become attached to the money role I think, and if struggling I will pass it very quickly to the person needed, but that person I must wait for at this moment until they are ready and willing].</p>

<p>The money to be acquired is as follows, 2 x 3 lots of $36,000.</p>

<p>How this will be spent is as follows:</p>

<p>I plan on turning a place at Coorparoo near the railway station in the industrial area where the Dance and Theatre studio is into a place of Church. [Notice it is not, 'the Church', it is a church and only a place of church until established to what I feel will be called, apart of the, 'Church' in whole, established by Christ.</p>

<p>Hence thus, the church is called, "body of Christ", but inside we will call it nothing. No name comes to mind when I feel it's true meaning but God's place and a setting of Christ and following of Jesus' strong teachings, as well as what I have learned along the way, trying to cut through all the red tape, and achieving it so, to deliver the way Christ intended, without perversion [if possible] of God's Way. As in meaning:- as if God's way would ever be perverted by me first in any attempt, God willing it not be so, and also, if perverting God's way were even possible, then it wouldn't be God's way, it would be another's, and this is wrong even to myself I know this, so thus who else would clearly see this thus apart from me.</p>

<p>God will guide me, but I must use my mind also to do what I think is best, as Jesus also said, why do you ask me (although he was being hindered at the time), sort amongst yourselves, what is good and what is not.</p>

<p>So to, I understand this in right context.</p>

<p>I believe we will be strong, and I don't believe any person will hate us.</p>

<p>Once they see this way, they will wonder what God was before they came, and realise that we are practicing God's true way.</p>

<p>Thank God for our Christ, thank God for the body, thank God for us; for we're connected and can connect again if lost and but not found.</p>

<p>Find God again peeps, life is not life without, but silence.</p>

<p>Fasting on Saturday's.</p>

<p>Sunday will be spontaneous praise, use of the steps to the platform.</p>

<p>Footnote: (although I don't see anyone standing a top of the platform, but only ever reaching the stairs, as the stairs seem more holy to us than the top, for at the top is God surely in our mindset, so why not let us reason with this for the practice of God in congregation; and let's remind ourselves we are not practicing God, we are practicing Christ, for without, God could not connect surely, for I have studied much and found that there is definitely need of this way for me, rather than any other method I know that man could ever practice - Church is good. But only church that fits the way God intended, or the way Christ wants it.</p>

<p>I believe of course, I've got that figured out for my understanding, and enough will come that it will make sense.)</p>

<p>Spontaneous praise continued in explanation:-</p>

<p>And so I may attend on Sunday's and bring myself to the stairs alone to sing a message to you, but others may dominate the stairs, and even multiple at a time creating a choir, but we should (who stands on a stair of the stairs, or stands on the stairs), should sing to God and to brothers and sisters what God wants, what Christ wants, what we all know to hear to be from inside.</p>

<p>Saturday's explained:-</p>

<p>The building should be opened:- so that people can come and go from early morning hours to late, to whenever, arriving when they want, to perform silent meditation; they can cipher through their books, the Holy Word, which we will not provide initially, but we prefer that people sit, take time to meditate, and seeing others meditate, may help them more easily to spend a whole day in meditation [the purpose for such rest], rather than just maybe an hour, half hour, or what so be it less or a little more when they do so by one's self at home or residence (as there can be many distractions I've noticed, but in my days of doing such, I simply integrate those things later on into my understanding; although I feel the extraordinary need that this be setup as such for people on Saturday, also maybe homeless people can come, but somewhere I will at right time setup proper life structure supporting systems for Godly people who want to follow Christ and want to change from their homelessness and acquire better foods, and better things, for this is fond of me).</p>

<p>During the week, it will most likely be closed at this time, although I may occupy the building, or almost live in it, should anyone knock on the door.</p>

<p>This is all I have in mindset of what I have received thus this morning.</p>

<p>Peace be to all.</p>

<p><strong>Dated. 4th July 2015 at 4:55am - time of finished.</strong></p>

<p>Further notes added after: 4:56am - I am hoping we will all stop eating of meats, and only accept people in the end who can only practice such things, not once a week, not twice, but always, that is no eating of meats, no intoxicants during the week, tea and coffee included, and no cold frozen foods, no heated cooked foods, but raw [fruit preferred] and herbs (as I understand vegies have very little micro nutrition as compared to my many years of research as a fruitarian, organic of course due to pesticides etc and gmo's etc etc.).</p>

<p>This is a hard practice, but brings good mental clarity, better consciousness, and is much a fast from most of the world. The rest such as greed, anger; murder and VIOLENCE - is very easy to get rid off after switching to such a practice.</p>

<p>Milks, spices, and fermented foods, including mushrooms; I have never found to be good neither, and inside I know this true not to be good foods to consume.</p>

<p>What you practice and fill yourself with, surely these things become evident in your life.</p>

<p>God bless all.</p>

<p>Looking forward to seeing this church start within a few days to a week maximum.</p>

<p>I hope someone will post this on a fund raiser otherwise I will do so myself.</p>

<p><strong>donations to be sent to - via paypal.</strong></p>

<p>I believe I can create an account with this email above and retrieve the funds and put it into a Bank account I've put to the side for this cause, but since so much is processed with Paypal these days, I may leave some of it in there for spendature or easy transferral.</p>

<p>The person who manages funds after me will see the funds and how they are moved for cause and reason to play out the above.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Any questions, ask, this is DEFINITELY not a hoax, and would not be caught doing thus, in secret or in open, such is rifle nuisance, so I will not tolerate a list of messages asking where the money goes, money is just the tool to purchase what's needed to set this up; honesty in a person comes first, and I've got that, I vouch for myself, and I know God's seen me in secret, so who am I to tell another anyway, but for Christ's sake as a brother, and one partaking the role above, that it thus shall be fine to send the money to the non-yet created paypal address, the email address is mine, and then I can safely transfer it to the right bank account when needed, or pay from the paypal account for ease on convenience and use paypal as the money holder temporarily for a short while.</p>

<p>Thank you for your understanding in advance if I have gained it so.</p>

<p>Bless.</p>
